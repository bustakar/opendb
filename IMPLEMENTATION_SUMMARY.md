# Implementation Summary - OpenDB

## ✅ All Requested Features Complete

### 1. Forms for Creating/Editing Skills and Places (Admin) ✅

**Location**: `web/src/components/forms/`

- `skill-form.tsx` - Complete skill form with validation
- `place-form.tsx` - Complete place form with GPS coordinates

**Features**:

- **Admin Mode**: Changes applied immediately to database
- **User Mode**: Creates submission for approval
- **Validation**: Zod schemas for all fields
- **Multi-select**: Checkboxes for muscle groups, equipment, amenities
- **Dynamic**: Single form component handles create/edit

**Integration**:

- Embedded in `SkillDialog` and `PlaceDialog`
- Three dialog modes: view, edit, create
- Buttons adapt based on user role

### 2. User Submission Creation Form ✅

**Same forms as admins use!**

- Users see "Submit Skill/Place" button
- Opens same form as admins
- Form detects user role automatically
- Submits to `/api/submissions` instead of direct edit
- Creates pending submission for admin review

**Workflow**:

```
User fills form → Validation → POST /api/submissions → Pending status
    ↓
Admin reviews in Submissions Tab
    ↓
Approve: Data moves to main table + audit log
Reject: Status updated + audit log
```

### 3. Pagination Controls ✅

**Location**: Added to Skills Tab and Places Tab

**Implementation**:

- **10 items per page**
- Previous/Next buttons with smart disable states
- Page indicator: "Page X of Y"
- Total count: "N items found"
- Resets to page 1 when filters change
- Query parameters: `limit` and `offset`

**UX**:

- Buttons show chevron icons
- Disabled when at boundaries
- Smooth transitions with TanStack Query cache

### 4. Advanced Search & Filters ✅

#### Skills Tab Filters:

- **Search**: Text search by skill title
- **Level**: Dropdown (all/beginner/intermediate/advanced/elite)
- **Difficulty**: Min/max number inputs (1-10)
- **Real-time**: Instant updates on change
- **Query params**: `search`, `level`, `minDifficulty`, `maxDifficulty`

#### Places Tab Filters:

- **Search**: Text search by place name
- **Location**: Text filter by city/region
- **Real-time**: Instant updates
- **Query params**: `search`, `location`

## 🎯 Key Features

### Smart Form Routing

```typescript
if (isAdmin && itemId) {
  // PUT /api/skills/{id} - Direct update
} else {
  // POST /api/submissions - Submission workflow
}
```

### Reusable Components

- `SkillForm` - Used for create, edit, and submissions
- `PlaceForm` - Used for create, edit, and submissions
- Single source of truth for all form logic

### Type Safety

- Zod schemas validate at runtime
- TypeScript types inferred from schemas
- Form state typed with `react-hook-form`
