### 4. **Unified Submission Workflow** 🔄

**How it works:**

1. **Users** click "Submit Skill/Place" or "Submit Edit"
2. Fill in the same form as admins use
3. Form is marked as "submission" instead of direct edit
4. Goes to **Submissions Tab** with "pending" status
5. **Admins** review and approve/reject
6. On approval, data moves to main tables
7. Audit log records the change

**Key benefits:**

- Same form for everyone
- No duplicate code
- Clear permission model
- Transparent process

## 🔧 Technical Details

### Form Technology

- **react-hook-form**: Efficient form state management
- **Zod**: Runtime type validation
- **@hookform/resolvers**: Zod integration
- **shadcn/ui forms**: Beautiful, accessible form components

### Data Flow

```
User fills form
     ↓
Validation (Zod)
     ↓
Submit to API
     ↓
If Admin: Direct to DB
If User:  To submissions table
     ↓
Admin reviews in Submissions Tab
     ↓
Approve: Move to main table + audit log
Reject: Update status + audit log
```

### API Integration

All forms use existing API endpoints:

- `POST /api/skills` - Admin create
- `PUT /api/skills/[id]` - Admin update
- `POST /api/submissions` - User submission
- Forms automatically choose the right endpoint based on role

## 📦 Bundle Size Impact

New dashboard bundle size:

- **Before**: 61.2 kB
- **After**: 121 kB (+59.8 kB)
- **Why**: Form validation + react-hook-form

This is acceptable because:

- All functionality in one bundle
- Code-split from landing page
- Cached after first load
- Better UX with instant client-side validation

3. **Bulk actions**: Admin batch approve/reject
4. **Export data**: Download skills/places as JSON/CSV

### UX Enhancements
