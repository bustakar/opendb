## Architecture

### Folder Structure

```
/opendb/
â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/              # Database
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ migrations/        # 10 SQL files
â””â”€â”€ web/                   # Next.js App
    â”œâ”€â”€ src/
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ app/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ (auth)/          # Login/Signup
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ api/             # 13 API routes
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ dashboard/       # Main dashboard
    â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ components/
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ dashboard/       # Tab components + Dialogs
    â”‚   â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ layout/          # NavBar, route guards
    â”‚   â”‚   â””â”€â”€ ui/              # shadcn components
    â”‚   â””â”€â”€ lib/
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ api/             # Auth helpers
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ hooks/           # useAuth
    â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ supabase/        # Supabase clients
    â”‚       â””â”€â”€ constants.ts     # Enums
    â””â”€â”€ package.json
```

### Key Design Decisions

#### 1. Unified Dashboard

- **Single entry point** for all users: `/dashboard`
- **Role-based tabs**: Same interface, different permissions
- **Dialogs over pages**: Keep everything in one place, no navigation needed

#### 2. Permissions Model

- **View**: All authenticated users (skills, places, submissions, audit logs)
- **Submit**: All authenticated users (create submissions)
- **Direct Edit**: Admin only (bypass submission process)
- **Review**: Admin only (approve/reject submissions)

#### 3. Submission Workflow

```
User submits â†’ Pending â†’ Admin reviews â†’ Approved/Rejected
                                â†“
                         Data moves to main tables
                                â†“
                         Audit log created
```

## What Works Right Now

âœ… **Complete user authentication flow**  
âœ… **Browse all skills and places**  
âœ… **View detailed information in dialogs**  
âœ… **Upvote places**  
âœ… **Submit change requests**  
âœ… **Admin review and approval workflow**  
âœ… **Complete audit trail**  
âœ… **Role-based access control**

## Development Commands

```bash
# Navigate to web folder
cd web/

# Development
npm run dev

# Build (production-ready)
npm run build

# Lint
npm run lint
```

## Environment Setup

1. Create Supabase project
2. Run all 10 migrations in order
3. Set environment variables in `web/.env.local`:

```env
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_URL=your-url
NEXT_PUBLIC_SUPABASE_ANON_KEY=your-key
```

4. Set admin role manually:

```sql
UPDATE profiles
SET role = 'admin'
WHERE email = 'your-email@example.com';
```
